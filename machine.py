# A note about the various opNxxx files:
#
# Conceptually all of those are part of the PDP11 class. But having one
# monolithic/large class file seemed less than ideal. Python does not
# allow multiple files for a single class.
#
# Was there a better way? Just give in and have one huge file??
#
# The opcode parsing/dispatch starts with the top 4 bits of the opcode;
# thus the names "op4" and "op4_dispatch_table". Further decoding from
# there is as defined by the pdp11 operation code encoding tree.
#
# A note about octal
#
# Octal notation is everywhere in the world of the PDP-11; it especially
# pervades the manuals when talking about I/O page addresses. The layout
# of special purpose CPU registers (e.g., MMU registers and the like)
# is often most sensical viewed as octal. This is especially true of
# instruction format decoding, where for example the MOV instruction
# is: 0o01<src><dst> where <src> is two octal digits (3 bits mode, 3 bits
# register number) and so is <dst>.
#
# Thus MOV R2,R3 is 0o010203 ... no one wants to think of that as 0x1083
#
# Given that octal therefore appears all over in low-level processor detail,
# it seems to make the most sense to just go with it, well, (almost)
# everywhere. Thus, for example, "MASK16 = 0o177777" not "MASK16 = 0xFFFF"
#
# Complaints about this decision should be written on the back
# of an eight dollar bill and deposited appropriately.

    # detail (presumably the PDP11 microarchitecture does something similar).
